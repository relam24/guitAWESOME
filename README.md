Project: guitAWESOME Live Site https://guitawesome.herokuapp.com/
SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION:
App that is dedicated to helping beginning musicians learn how to play by sharing chords and tabs along with youtube videos to play along to. This is actually the exact way I learned how to play guitar. Looking up the chords and tabs and then listening along on youtube.

APPROACH: 
Technologies Used: Node.js, Mongoose, Express, AngularJS, HTML, and CSS. Full crud and using MVC structure.
We wanted to build an app dedicated to musicians who just want to chill and learn new songs as Olena plays ukulele and I play guitar. We found a scraper dedicated to Ultimate Guitar but it didn't seem like it was actually an API so we opted to keep it out. The theme is very nature/mountain/campfire as it tied in really well with the relaxing tone we were going for.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:
As I said earlier, figuring out the API to the scraper that was not exactly an API was very hard. I would like to figure out how to render the videos onto the page so it does not have to re-direct you to seperate websites. By far, the hardest thing about this project was dealing with branching and not overwriting each other's code. I definitely can get better in that aspect.

We both had a ton of fun doing this project, it was a really good balance between the fun we were having and being challenging. Also, there was a great debate between naming our app guitAWESOME and guitAWWWYEAHHHH.
